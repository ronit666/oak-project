                    Excellent care & service. I have been a patient at this surgery since approximately 1981. 
                    Needless to say there have been many changes since then! However the excellent care & access to 
                    Doctors & services have remained the same though now aided & abetted by technology & a much expanded practice. 
                    I felt compelled to write a review (my first) as what I have come to expect as standard everywhere, 
                    I find after discussions with family & friends this certainly is not always the case. I can get through 
                    on the telephone, I can see a Doctor on the same day if I need to, a Doctor will speak with me on the telephone 
                    if necessary & with some forethought & planning by myself I can see a Doctor of my choice. My children & grandchildren have all been patients & the 
                    continuity of us generally seeing the same Doctor has for us certainly made it a family practice. The Reception staff are 
                    helpful & obliging & there seems to be many other services available which I have fortunately not often needed. Sadly some Doctors 
                    have taken their well earned retirement. However, it seems those who replace them are imbued with the same ethos. In the light of 
                    the NHS being as stretched as it is, I think I am extremely fortunate to have access to such a practice, as what I have been 
                    considering as standard practice is, I think, possibly unique. So thank you.
